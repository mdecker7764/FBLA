					<p>Steak wins if it is extremely tender, however, chicken is alway juicy unless the cook overcooks it. Thus Chicken Wins usually, even then it tastes like burnt logs if it gets overcooked, if chicken is over cooked steak wins, but chicken has many flavors that makes it different each time. Chicken wins a majority of the time due to its complex taste as steak tastes the same every single time.</p>

				    <h2>What About Potatoes?</h2>
				    <p>Potatoes are fun things that exist, they are delicous and beautiful, they are the almighty, the most powerful being in the world. They will take over one day, and that day will be the most glorious day ever! All bow down to the almighty potato goddess and her minions. Thus, the true winner is potato, it can never be messed up and tastes perfect every single time.</p>

				    <h2>What about other foods?</h2>
				    <p>Other foods such as cake and other meats are good, but have many flaws. They have many ways that can make the food become disgusting, you can over cook cakes, brokoly, spaghetti, etc. Even chocolate can get over cooked, and when it does it is a huge mess!<a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" id="fri"> Only potatoes can be perfect always.  </a></p>

				    <h2>Best Ways To cook Food</h2>
				    <ul>
				        <li>Chicken</li>
				        <ol>
				            <li>Brine: fill a bowl with lukewarm water, not hot, and pour in a handful of salt and mix it until its mostly disolved. then place the chicken in the water for around fifteen minutes.</li>
				            <li>Brush: Brush the chicken breasts liberally on both sides with melted butter to prevent it sticking to the pan.</li>
				            <li>Rub: To keep in simple, just sprinkle some salt and pepper on the chicken.</li>
				            <li>Roast: Set oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit and set a timer to 15-18 minutes so that the chicken gets cooked properly</li>
				            <li>Rest: No matter what let your chicken rest before cutting them, if you cut into the chicken right away you'll loose all the juice from it, letting it rest makes the chicken extremely tender and delicious.</li>
				        </ol>
